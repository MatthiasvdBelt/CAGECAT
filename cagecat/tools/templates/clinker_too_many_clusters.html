            The number of selected clusters to plot exceeds the set limit of clinker. Your cblaster search resulted
            in {{ cluster_number }} clusters, and the limit for plotting with clinker is {{ cluster_threshold }}
            clusters.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are able to bypass this limitation by manually selecting <{{ cluster_threshold }} clusters on the result
            page of your
            cblaster search job, extracting these clusters via an "Extract clusters" job, and executing clinker as a
            downstream analysis from this "Extract clusters" job.
